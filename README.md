## Project Overview: RyxEmu

### Project Goals:

64-bit client will be default. We will support 32-bit but it's not that main goal.

1. Much faster HP and mana regen. // To Be set by server admin and can be adjusted on the fly.

2. Generally much faster exp than live server. Make it similar to either EQ test server or FV server. // Also able to be set to by admin and/or era.

3. Much more custom quests. They would involve assassination of specific mob(s), or killing of certain number of a type of mob etc. Other quests could be delivery quests. These should give great exp and rewards. // Add an easy questing system to edit and add without coding from admin. *Side note* EQ used to have a lot more locked doors requiring rogues. Make them more useful.

4. Treasure goblins potentially spawning on a random basis that can be killed for treasure an/or loot or crystal drops that can be used to get special purchasable items from vendors. This one point is already implemented on Imperium and is liked by players. // Admin enabled and customizable.

5. Much faster skill gains than that of live servers. // Admin setup with gains.

6. Everyone able to make any tradeskill items with ingredients cheaper than that of live. More and better tradeskill items. // Admin setup for how far they want to go.

7. Daily quests found in hub // Admin can set a hub. It does not need to be POP.

8. Easy teleport port system to almost any zone. // Admin on/off switch. As well as a custom teleport system for which zones and which zones cannot be teleported to.

9. No starting faction issues by any race. // Admin on/off switch. As well if you want to keep some and not others or change.

10. GM events daily that are posted hopefully giving players some notice. // Easy editing of login messages that check any changes.

11. Much faster AA gains and new and better AAs while eliminating some of the crappy AAs. // Admin level sets.

12. More solo friendly by reducing hp of mobs and their ability to summon players or create pets. However, this probably wouldn't apply to the same extent to raid or boss mobs. // Mercenaries or can adjust on a percentage. Also OMW+ has way too many summon trash.

14. Vendors in Hub selling most spells. // Admin decision. As it can cause a disconnect between players and grouping.

15. Tradeskill vendors in hub having all ingredients for items. Also, better tradeskill items especially bows, arrows, and potions. Most tradeskill items should mean something and have worth and demand by players. // Admin adjustable.

17. A good website explaining the benefits of this server, the unique quests etc. // Working on the database/website integration.
